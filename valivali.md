##  valivali
**A SAS package to support validation tasks**

Valivali is a validation toolbox that provides utilities to test and validate SAS packages.  
Use it during package creation and verification to ensure expected behavior and reproducible results.  
Valivali loads {sasjscore} package developed by Allan Bowe when valivali is loaded and strongly influenced and powered by {sasjscore}.  
By loading valivali, users can utilize valivali original macros in addition to {sasjscore} macros for validation.  

Available macros for validations are as below.
- %mp_assertdataset	: To see datasets are equal by proc compare    
- %mp_assert				: To see if condition is TRUE (from sasjscore)  
- %mp_assertcols		: To see if columns(variables) are in expected condition (from sasjscore)    
- %mp_assertcolvals	: To see if values in variables are in expected condition (from sasjscore)  
- %mp_assertdsobs		: To see if # of observations is in expected condition (from sasjscore)  
- %mp_assertscope		: To check macro scope (from sasjscore)

2. [License note](#license)

## `%mp_assertdataset()` macro <a name="mpassertdataset-macro-1"></a> ######

### Macro:

    %mp_assertdataset

### Purpose:

    Compares two SAS data sets using `PROC COMPARE` and asserts equality. Writes a concise PASS/FAIL
    message to the SAS log and optionally appends a row to an output results data set.

### Parameters:

 - `base` (required): Data set used as BASE in PROC COMPARE.

 - `compare` (required): Data set used as COMPARE in PROC COMPARE.

 - `desc` (optional): Free-text description of the assertion; stored in the output table when `outds` is set.  

 - `puttolog` (optional, default=Y): To switch put NOTE and ERROR of PASS/FAIL into log  
    (Can change to puttolog=N if FAIL is expected in test)  

 - `id` (optional): ID variable list for PROC COMPARE (e.g., `id=USUBJID`).

 - `by` (optional): BY variable list for PROC COMPARE (e.g., `by=USUBJID VISIT`).

 - `criterion` (optional, default=0): Tolerance for comparisons (PROC COMPARE `criterion=`).

 - `method` (optional, default=absolute): Comparison method (PROC COMPARE `method=`).

 - `outds` (optional, default=work.test_results): Results table to append a PASS/FAIL record.

### Returns:

    Creates/updates the data set named in `outds`, prints PASS/FAIL to the log.

### Sample code:

~~~sas
%mp_assertdataset(
  base=work.adsl_expected,
  compare=work.adsl_actual,
  desc=Check ADSL content matches,
  puttolog=Y,
  id=USUBJID,
  by=USUBJID VISIT,
  criterion=1e-12,
  method=absolute,
  outds=work.unit_test_results
);
~~~
### Notes:

 - `NE` (number of diffs) from PROC COMPARE is used to determine PASS (NE=0) or FAIL (NE>0).

 - If `outds` does not exist, it will be created with standard columns (`test_description`, `test_result`, `test_comments`).

 - This macro does not modify input data; it only reads them to compare.
